## 2.0.0
To celebrate one year of the web port, we're bumping up its major version number to 2 and changing its name to "Marble Blast Web" with by far its biggest update yet. There are too many changes to be able to list them all, but here are the main ones:

- **Implemented Marble Blast Platinum.** Well, at least the single-player part of it. This includes a completely new menu, new levels, new options, new sounds, new music and new gameplay elements. The added gameplay elements are checkpoints, teleporters, nukes, magnets, MBP frictions, bouncy floor, random power-ups and easter eggs.
- **Added 1608 new levels.** This includes the 120 MBP default levels as well as 1488 MBP customs taken from Marbleland.
- **Implemented game switching.** To still be able to play the pure Marble Blast Gold, you can now quickly switch between the two games in the main menu.
- **Made physics more consistent.** Continuous collision detection got a makeover, so all collision (including edge-hits) should be way more accurate and reliable now. Hitting internal edges should also happen much more rarely now.
- **Added a fancy new particle renderer.** Tens of thousands of particles on screen at one time will now run smooth like butter. Like a criminal undercover.
- **Many bugfixes and improvements.** Tons of smaller bugs and inconsistencies were fixed and the game was optimized and improved in many places.

## 1.5.0
This patch focuses on a full backend rewrite. The client is mostly the same.

- Leaderboard updates are now lazy: The client requests only the parts of the leaderboard that it can currently display.
- Score submission is similarly optimized, only new scores are sent instead of all local scores. Additionally, replay upload happens concurrently with score submission to avoid multiple requests.

## 1.4.0
This patch is meant to be an overall "quality of life" update to the port, rounding off the experience. Major changes are:
- **Replays can now be downloaded and saved as .wrec files.** To do this, simply Alt-Click the replay icon in the scores. .wrecs can be played back using the small play icon in the corner of the level selector.
- **Fan physics have been reworked.** With the help of RandomityGuy, they should be much closer to the original now. This means that Battlements and Airwalk will now be somewhat more enjoyable to play.
- Speaking of Airwalk, **positional sounds now get their volume reduced if they appear in clumps.** So, no more earrape from fans.
- **Sliding has been adjusted**. Now just requires any movement buttons to be pressed and an angle of 30Â° or less, instead of the previous 45Â°.
- **Tons of bugfixes regarding broken custom levels.** Fixes include levels not loading, MBP textures not loading, not being able to finish when OOB, missing qualifying times, going negative with Time Travels, falling through terrain, and other things.
- **Shape hitboxes have been fixed**. So no more glitchy trapdoors.
- **Interiors are now smoothly shaded and instanced**. Basically, this means that curved surfaces now look smoother and lots of the same interior in one level should be more performant now.
- **The marble can now be made reflective** in the graphics options.
- **Safari finally gets music**. Yes.
- **Migrated to IndexedDB entirely**, ditching localStorage.
